# AdaEngine
 A game engine made in java with LWJGL

A Work in progress 2D game engine.

## Features I'd like in this:
- Ability to add premade components to objects using the UI
- Add the ability for users to script and create custom components
- Ability to properly export game while stripping unneeded engine stuff
- Export the Engine properly

## TODO:
- [ ] Add a free move plane to the translate gizmo
- [ ] Change add component menu to more unity like that the current popup one
